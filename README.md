# Sorting Visualizer

This is, as the title suggests, a Sorting Visualizer.

Made using React.js, it helps visualize how different sorts actually happen, how the numbers are shuffled, how the elements are swapped, etc.

To get a clearer picture of the sorting method being used, there is the functionality to choose the number of elements to be sorted and the speed at which the elements are being sorted.

As of now, I have added most of the sorting methods here. Methods yet to be added are Merge Sort, Bucket Sort, etc.
